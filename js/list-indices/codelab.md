# List Indices

## Requirements
You are given a file that contains a list called `animals`.

Write a program to print out a user's selection from the list.

Your program should take an input number from the user, and print off which element in the list that is â€”
so for an input of `1` your program should print off the first element in the list, and so on.

For example, if the file is:

```javascript
const animals = ['dog', 'cat', 'mouse', 'rat'];
```

... then the program output would look like:

```text
Which animal? 1
That animal is: dog
```

Here's another example:

```javascript
const animals = ['kangaroo', 'emu', 'koala'];
```

```text
Which animal? 3
That animal is: koala
```

**Tip**: Remember that lists start at **index 0**, so you will need to convert the input number to the
corresponding index of this list.

## Your turn
Download and **unzip** the template from [https://github.com/projectmaterial/js-template/archive/master.zip](https://github.com/projectmaterial/js-template/archive/master.zip).

Add this code:

```javascript
const num = Number(prompt('Which animal?'));

const animals = ['dog', 'cat', 'mouse', 'rat'];
```

Complete the code so we get the required output.

## Solution
We were provided with this code:

```javascript
const num = Number(prompt('Which animal?'));

const animals = ['dog', 'cat', 'mouse', 'rat'];
```

Notice that `num` is off by one compared to the item's index in `animals`. For example, when `num` is `1`, we want to get the **index** of `0`. Similarly, when `num` is `3`, we want the **index** of `2`.

Let's keep a variable for this index:

```javascript
const index = num - 1;
```

Finally, let's print out the required value from the list using `[]`:

```javascript
console.log('That animal is: ' + animals[index]);
```

Here's the complete solution:

```javascript
const num = Number(prompt('Which animal?'));

const animals = ['dog', 'cat', 'mouse', 'rat'];
const index = num - 1;

console.log('That animal is: ' + animals[index]);
```
