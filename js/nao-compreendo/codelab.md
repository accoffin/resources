# NaÌƒo Compreendo

## Background
You're in Brazil for a holiday! You're going to need a few Portuguese words to help you get around.

## Requirements
Write a program to translate some useful words from Portuguese. Here are the words you need (from Portuguese to English):

Ola -> Hello
Sim -> Yes
Nao -> No

Your program should ask for the Portuguese word then print out the English translation. For example:
```text
What did they say? Ola
Hello
```

Here is another example:
```text
What did they say? Sim
Yes
```

If the Portuguese word isn't one of the three above, your program should print *Nao compreendo.* which means "I don't understand." in Portuguese. For example:

```text
What did they say? Desculpe
Nao compreendo.
```

**Hint**: Use an `if`, `else if` and `else` in your code!

## Your turn
Download and **unzip** the template from [https://github.com/projectmaterial/js-template/archive/master.zip](https://github.com/projectmaterial/js-template/archive/master.zip).

Start off with this code:

```javascript
const phrase = prompt('What did they say?');
```

Complete the code so we get the required output.

## Solution
We were provided the code to get the `phrase` that was spoken in Portuguese.

```javascript
const phrase = prompt('What did they say?');
```

Recall that `if` and `else if` let us test for multiple cases. For each Portuguese word, I've checked it against the phrase for equality (`===`):

```javascript
if (phrase === 'Ola') {
    console.log('Hello');
} else if (phrase === 'Sim') {
    console.log('Yes');
} else if (phrase === 'Nao') {
    console.log('No');
}
```

When there's a match I've printed the English translation.

Now, what about in the case where we don't know what they are saying? We can use an `else` for when **no** previous tested condition matches:

```javascript
if (phrase === 'Ola') {
    console.log('Hello');
} else if (phrase === 'Sim') {
    console.log('Yes');
} else if (phrase === 'Nao') {
    console.log('No');
} else {
    console.log('Nao compreendo.');
}
```

Here's the complete solution:

```javascript
const phrase = prompt('What did they say?');

if (phrase === 'Ola') {
    console.log('Hello');
} else if (phrase === 'Sim') {
    console.log('Yes');
} else if (phrase === 'Nao') {
    console.log('No');
} else {
    console.log('Nao compreendo.');
}
```
