# Coding Resources

Extra resources we've written or curated for [Knowin](https://knowin.app/). These resources are selected to provide opportunities to practice and apply skills. Resources we curate or write are free for everyone to learn from.

## Development
All resources are written in Markdown. If you're new to Markdown, check out [this guide](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) from GitHub. Markdown is processed using [Codelabs](https://github.com/googlecodelabs/tools), which converts the plain Markdown in a HTML website.
