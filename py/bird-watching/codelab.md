# Bird Watching

## Introduction
Biologists often have to go bird watching to do studies on how many birds there are in an area.

## Requirements
Write a program to take in a list of animals that you spot, and `print` each one on a new line.

However if you see 'bird', you should shout BIRD! instead so your colleague can keep count of them.

Here is an example:

```text
Animals: rodent rodent bird insect
rodent
rodent
BIRD!
insect
```

and another example:

```text
Animals: insect insect insect bird rodent ungulate insect ungulate
insect
insect
insect
BIRD!
rodent
ungulate
insect
ungulate
```

On the next page we have some hints for solving this problem.

## Research task
This task will require some **research** to solve!

You'll notice the input (from the user) is given as a **string** (such as `insect insect insect bird rodent ungulate insect ungulate`), however we need is a **list of strings** to solve the problem.

To do this, we need a way to split the user's input into pieces. Here is an example (not directly related to our problem) to get you thinking:

```python
data = input('Enter some marsupials: ')
marsupials = ?
print(marsupials)
```

What code would you replace the `?` with so `marsupials` contains `['possum', 'wombat', 'kangaroo']` when the input is `possum wombat kangaroo`?

Coders often research coding syntax and technique while writing programs. Try using **Google** to solve this problem of creating a **list** from a **string**!

If you spend more than 15 minutes searching for solution, have a look at the **Research task solution** page next.

## Research task (solution)
So far our programs have always asked the user for a single piece of input, either a number or a string, which we've stored in a variable.

If we want to get multiple pieces of input from the user, we could store them in a list.

To do that, we need a way to split the user's input into pieces â€” we can do this using the `.split` method:

```python
data = input('Enter some marsupials: ')
marsupials = data.split()
print(marsupials)
```

This program asks the user for a list of marsupials (as a string) and stores these in a variable data. It then uses the `split` method to convert this to a list.

`split` takes an input string and splits it between any whitespace characters (which include spaces, tabs
and newline characters).

To find this on **Google**, I used the keywords of *Python convert string to list*. When searching for things on Google, it's a good idea to include the coding language you want (i.e. *Python*).

## Solution
Now onto solution for the problem!

Let's used what we learned from the research task to get a list of `animals` from the user:

```python
data = input('Enter some animals: ')
animals = data.split()
```

Now we have to loop through every `animal`. When the `animal` is equal to `'bird'` we print out *BIRD!*, otherwise we just print out the animal name:

```python
for animal in animals:
    if animal == 'bird':
        print('BIRD!')
    else:
        print(animal)
```

Here's the entire solution:

```python
data = input('Enter some animals: ')
animals = data.split()

for animal in animals:
    if animal == 'bird':
        print('BIRD!')
    else:
        print(animal)
```
