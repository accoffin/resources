# How Good Is Your Vocabulary?

## Introduction
If you're a fan of hangman you need to know some long words. English has a lot of very [long words](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Longest_word_in_English).

The longest non‚Äêtechnical word in the English language is antidisestablishmentarianism. At 28 letters it is a very long word.

You want to test your friends' vocabulary by seeing how close they can get to the longest word.

## Requirements
Write a program to read in the longest word your friends can think of and tell them how close they are to the length of "antidisestablishmentarianism":

```text
Long word: incomprehensibilities
It is 7 letter(s) shorter than the longest word.
```

Here is another example:
```text
Long word: unimaginatively
It is 13 letter(s) shorter than the longest word.
```

If the long word is longer than 28 characters, it should print out the negative number of letters:

```text
Long word: supercalifragilisticexpialidocious
It is -6 letter(s) shorter than the longest word.
```

But we all know that's not a *real* word.

## Solution
This sounds like a fun project. Just so I have it handy in the program, I'll keep a hold of the **longest English** word in a **variable**:

```python
longest_word = 'antidisestablishmentarianism'
```

Now, I'll ask the user for the longest word they know:

```python
long_word = input('Long word: ')
```

Now, I have two words in two **variables**, and the question says we should calculate the difference in **length** between the two words.

At this point I remembered you can use `len()` in Python to find out the number of characters a string has. If I didn't remember this I would probably search **Google** (just search *length of string python*)!

Let's calculate the difference of the lengths:

```python
remaining_character_count = len(longest_word) - len(long_word)
```

Finally, we have to tell the user:

```python
print(f'It is {remaining_character_count} letter(s) shorter than the longest word.')
```

All up, this is my program:

```python
longest_word = 'antidisestablishmentarianism'
long_word = input('Long word: ')

remaining_character_count = len(longest_word) - len(long_word)

print(f'It is {remaining_character_count} letter(s) shorter than the longest word.')
```
