# Your Town (assignment)

## Introduction
The hypothetical tourist board in your town is unhappy with its Wikipedia entry and it wants **you** to make a new marketing website for it that's similar to Wikipedia (i.e. full of information) but only with **positive information**.

## Requirements
Your website should have:

- Headings (e.g. a title, a section on geography or a section on the top attractions)
- Text (e.g. a short description of your town's history)
- A list (e.g. a list of notable people from your town, or things to do)

## Solution
Assignments have many different possible solutions.
